HMLauncherView is an UI component which mimics the iOS homescreen (a.k.a SpringBoard) behaviour. 
Added icons can be reordered and removed. In addition the HMLauncherView supports drag&drop of icons between several HMLauncherView instances.

## Usage

To run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

The HMLaucherView needs a datasource and a delegate. The implementation of `HMLauncherDataSource` has to provide the grid dimensions (columns/rows), the number of pages,
and accessor methods to the `HMLaucherIcon`s, which represents the icons of the laucher view. 

The `HMLauncherViewDelegate` should react to any interactions (like dragging, tapping, deleting) on the launcher view. In addition the delegate is resposible to find out
to which the current dragged `HMLaucherIcon` belongs to.  

Checkout the [LauncherService](Example/HMLauncherViewExample/LauncherService.m) class of the example project.
